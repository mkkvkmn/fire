# FiRe - Financial Independence, Retire Early

This is a personal finance tracking application made with Python and Power BI.

It eats .csv and .xlsx files and outputs reports.

## What You Get

- Overall understanding of you finances as a Power BI report
  - Income, costs, assets & liabilities, dividend income, fire estimate
- Ability to set and track targets
- Multiperson household support

## Quick Guide

1. Grab the [Power BI file](x_stuff/pbi/) and see if you like the contents
2. [Install](#install) environment
3. [Run datapipeline](./data_pipeline/) to make sure it works
4. Use you own data ([config](./config/))
5. Run datapipeline with your own data
6. Update Power BI and analyze your finances

## Migrations

If you have have used v1, please see the [Migration from v1 to v2 Guide](data_pipeline/src/data_processing/migration_scripts/readme.md) for instructions on automatically or manually migrating your data.

! important: Version 2.0 will recalculate id fields for your data. This will break `fixes.csv` and you need to manually find the new id for each fix.

## Install

1. create virtual environment:

```shell
python -m venv venv
```

2. activate:

macOS/Linux:

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

Windows:

```shell
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. install dependencies

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Config

See how to use your own data with [config](./config/).

[Data pipeline documentation and user guide](./data_pipeline/)

## Logic Backend

Coming someday...
