# FiRe - Config

## Settings

The application settings are configured in the [settings.py](./settings.py) file.

You should use your own data and config files from outside the repository with the help of an .env file.

### .env

You can overwrite settings in settings.py with environment variables.

- Add .env file to project root (fire)
- Use your own data and config folder

Example .env file contents:

```
DATA_FOLDER = "../my_data/data"
CONFIG_FOLDER = "../my_data/config"
DEFAULT_OWNER = "mkk"
USE_TARGETS = True
USE_NORDNET_PORTFOLIO = True
LOG_FILE="./logs/logs.log"
```

## Source File Reader

In [config/source_file_reader](./source_file_reader/) we tell the data pipeline how each source file is read using .yml files.

If you have a files.csv from V1, it will be converted into .yml files when you run the data_pipeline for the first time. Files.csv is depracated in v 2.0.

Let's say you have a source file called credit_card_transactions.csv, an example .yml looks like this:

```
"id": "11"
"pattern": "credit_card"
"account": "credit_card_visa"
"delimiter": ","
"date_format": "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
"day_first": "FALSE"
"columns":
  "date": "TransactionDate"
  "amount": "Amount"
  "description": "Text"
  "info": "Merchant Category"
```

.yml files are not defined for each file but for each pattern. Meaning you can use the example .yml file from above to read

credit_card_1.csv\
credit_card_2.csv\
etc.

## Data Processing

In [config/data_processing](./data_processing/) we tell the data pipeline how are data should be categorized.

- categories.csv -> assign class, category and sub_category for you data
- fixes.csv -> overwrite assigned category, useful forexample if you buy a tv from the store where by default you get groceries
- splits.csv -> you can split data by owner, useful for multiperson households
- targets.csv -> set monthly targets for income or costs class / category / sub_category
